Workflows
=========

What pools and platforms are available?
---------------------------------------

For pool/platform availability, refer to :ref:`Pool CLI Reference <cli_reference_pool>`.

How to fix 403 error when accessing OSMO UI?
--------------------------------------------

Clear your browser cache and cookies. If the problem persists, contact the admin to verify
your roles.

How to fix 403 error when submitting a workflow?
------------------------------------------------

403 error indicates a permission issue when submitting workflows to the specified pool. To fix this,

1. Contact your admin to confirm your roles.

2. Clear your browser cache and cookies.

3. Logout and re-login. Follow the :ref:`Login CLI <cli_reference_login>`.

3. Check if the pool is accessible in your profile using the :ref:`Profile List CLI <cli_reference_profile_list>`.

How to fix OSMO exec hangs?
---------------------------

If you encounter a hang when using ``osmo workflow exec``, you can check the following:

1. Check if the task has RUNNING status

2. If the task shows RUNNING, check if the user command (the command defined for the task in the workflow spec) is running by looking at the logs.
   Sometimes the task is running and downloading inputs, but the user command has not started.

3. If the user command is not running, wait for 5 minutes and try ``osmo workflow exec`` again after it starts running.

How to pause and debug a workflow?
----------------------------------

Typically, when debugging a workflow that crashes or hangs, forcing the workflow to ``pause``
can help you diagnose the problem. Pausing the process gives you a chance to get a remote
shell into the workflow, look inside the container, determine or fix the issue, and then ``unpause``
the workflow when ready.

To pause a workflow, add the following command to the top of the script running inside your workflow:

.. code-block:: bash

  while ! [ -f /done.txt ] ; do sleep 1 ; done

This causes the workflow to halt, and wait until the file ``/done.txt`` is created, after which it
resumes.

For example, your workflow might contain the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

  workflow:
    tasks:
    - name: my_task
      command: bash
      args: ["/tmp/script.sh"]
      files:
      - path: "/tmp/script.sh"
        contents: |
          while ! [ -f /done.txt ] ; do sleep 1 ; done
          # The rest of script here ...


After the workflow starts and halts, this should give you a chance to shell into the workflow (See :ref:`Interactive Workflows <workflow_interactive_exec>`) and potentially modify files. After you are finished with the shell, you can resume the workflow by creating the `/done.txt`
file with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ touch /done.txt


How to force cancel a workflow?
--------------------------------

When a cancel request for a workflow is submitted, it is canceled asynchronously.
If the resources associated with the workflow are not cleaned up properly on the backend,
the incoming workflows are in a ``PENDING`` state.
Forcing a *cancel* frees the resources instantaneously.

To force cancel a workflow, use the ``--force`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ osmo workflow cancel --force <workflow_id>

.. note::

  To learn more about the cancel CLI, go to :ref:`cli_reference_workflow_cancel`.

How to stop a hanging workflow without canceling it?
----------------------------------------------------

In cases your workflow is hanging and you want to stop it but still have OSMO upload your output data,
you can use the `osmo exec` command. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ osmo workflow exec <workflow_id> <task_id> --entry "/bin/sh -c \"kill -9 \\\$( ps aux | grep '[p]ython' | head -n1 | awk '{print \\\$2}' )\""

This command will kill the first python process running in the workflow and allow OSMO to upload the output data.

It is equivalent to first shell into the task and then run the command manually:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ osmo workflow exec <workflow_id> <task_id>

.. code-block:: bash

  $ /bin/sh -c "kill -9 $( ps aux | grep '[p]ython' | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}' )"

How to reschedule a running task?
-----------------------------------

If you have a task that is hanging and you want to reschedule it, you can configure exit actions in your workflow specification.

1. Add exit actions to your task definitions in the workflow YAML:

.. code-block:: yaml

  workflow:
    tasks:
    - name: my_task
      exitActions:
        RESCHEDULE: 137

2. Kill the hanging processes in the tasks using the following command for example (Assuming your hanging process is a python script):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ osmo workflow exec <workflow_id> <task_id> --entry "/bin/sh -c \"kill -9 \\\$( ps aux | grep '[p]ython' | head -n1 | awk '{print \\\$2}' )\""

When you use ``kill -9`` to terminate a process, it sends the SIGKILL signal. The process will exit with code 137 (128 + 9), which triggers the RESCHEDULE action you configured.

.. note::

  This also means your task will automatically be rescheduled if it is failed due to OOM. For more information about exit actions, see :ref:`workflow_spec_exit_actions`.

.. _faq_workflow_resource_usage:

How to determine the resource usage of a workflow?
--------------------------------------------------

Follow the ``grafana_url`` for your workflow fetched using the :ref:`cli_reference_workflow_query` CLI to determine the resource usage of your workflows.

Alternately, you can click on the ``Resource Usage`` button in the UI on the detailed workflow information page.

.. image:: workflow_ui_resource_usage.png
  :width: 1200
  :alt: Alternative text
  :align: center

Grafana dashboard displays resource usage metrics for CPU, memory, and GPU for your workflow.

.. image:: grafana.png
  :width: 1200
  :alt: Alternative text
  :align: center


How to browse previously submitted workflows?
---------------------------------------------

Refer to :ref:`workflow list <cli_reference_workflow_list>` to list workflows.

How to mount datasets inside the workflow?
------------------------------------------

Direct per-workflow input mounting is not supported. Admins can expose S3-backed OSMO
dataset inputs through an existing FSx for Lustre mount by configuring
``downloadType: fsx-lustre``, dataset bucket ``fsx_lustre.mount_path``, and pod
template volume mounts for ``osmo-ctrl`` and the user container. Dataset outputs
and dataset updates still use the normal OSMO upload paths.

How to update datasets inside the workflow?
-------------------------------------------

Multiple tasks of a workflow or multiple workflows can operate and update the same dataset. See :ref:`Update Dataset <cli_reference_dataset_update>`.

How to Handle Failed Tasks?
---------------------------

To manually rerun tasks in a workflow that have failed, see :ref:`cli_reference_workflow_restart`

To have your workflow automatically reschedule and retry failed tasks, see  :ref:`workflow_spec_exit_actions`

For a practical example of rescheduling training workflows for backend errors, see `here <https://github.com/NVIDIA/OSMO/tree/main/cookbook/dnn_training/torchrun_reschedule>`__.

How to save the intermediate data when the workflow is stuck or hangs?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can save your data in the workflow by running the OSMO CLI while exec'd into the workflow.

See :ref:`tutorials_advanced_patterns_osmo_cli_wf` for how to perform this operation.

How to access a private GitHub repository from a workflow?
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Create an access token

Log into GitHub and create a `classic personal access token <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>`_ if you don't already have one.
Be sure to give the token all **repo** permissions.

2. Verify that the token is valid by cloning the repo locally

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://token:ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx@g<token>@github.com/<user>/<repo>.git

3. Create an osmo secret for the token

.. code-block:: bash

  export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
  osmo credential set github-pat --type GENERIC --payload "github-pat=$GITHUB_TOKEN"

4. Use the secret in a workflow

First, add the credential to any tasks in the workflow that need to access GitHub.

.. code-block:: yaml

  workflow:
    name: my_workflow
    tasks:
    - name: my_task
      credentials:
        github-pat: /tmp/github

Then, run the following code in the workflow to authenticate and clone the repo.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Configure git to use the token for all requests to GitHub
  GITHUB_PAT=$(cat /tmp/github/github-pat)
  git config --global credential.helper store
  echo "https://token:${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com" > ~/.git-credentials
  git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.git-credentials'

  # Clone the repo
  git clone https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git


How to find a task's IP address from another task within the same group?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks in the same group can communicate with each other through network.
OSMO token ``{{host:<task_name>}}`` (see :ref:`workflow_spec_special_tokens`) can be used as the hostname of a task.
In case you need to find the IP address of a task, you can use the following command to resolve the hostname to an IP address:

.. code-block:: bash

  TASK_IP=$(nslookup {{host:<task_name>}} | grep -oP \
    'Address: \K\d[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' | head -n1)


How to upload a file/directory as an input to a workflow?
---------------------------------------------------------

To upload a file/directory as an input to a workflow, you can use a ``dataset`` input with the
``localpath`` field. For more information, see :ref:`ds_localpath`.

How to debug when preemption occurs?
------------------------------------

When a task is preempted, it will have the status ``FAILED_PREEMPTED`` and exit code ``3006``.
You can also check task events to see preemption events from the scheduler.

If you need to automatically retry preempted tasks, you can configure exit actions to reschedule the task when it receives exit code ``3006``.
See :ref:`workflow_exit_codes` for more information.

Your admin can configure the default exit action to ``RESCHEDULE`` the task when it receives exit code ``3006``.
The preempted task will be rescheduled with the same priority up to maximum time limit before it fails with status ``FAILED_PREEMPTED``.
Check with the admin about current configurations.

.. _faq_why_is_my_workflow_not_getting_scheduled_quickly:

Why is my workflow not getting scheduled quickly?
-------------------------------------------------

There are several reasons why your workflow might be stuck in a ``PENDING`` state.
Here are the most common causes and how to investigate them:

1. **Resource Availability**

   - Check if the requested resources (CPU, GPU, memory) are available in your pool

   - Use the :ref:`Resource CLI <cli_reference_resource>` commands to see current resource utilization

   - Consider if both total resources and resource per node are available in your pool

   - Consider adjusting your resource requests if they're too high

2. **Pool Quotas and Sharing**

   - Use the :ref:`Pool CLI <cli_reference_pool>` commands to check if your pool has reached its quota limit

   - You cannot exceed the quota for non-preemptible workflows (HIGH/NORMAL priority)

   - Submit preemptible workflows if you want to use shared quotas.

   For example, if you submit a normal/high priority workflow to this pool with 10 GPUs:

   .. code-block:: bash

                                                            Quota Used   Quota Limit   Total Usage   Total Capacity
    ============================================================================================================
    example-pool   Join role: example-role      ONLINE      96           100           96            200
    ============================================================================================================
                                                            96           100           96            200

   Because the current quota used is 96 GPUs, and quota limit is 100 GPUs, a workflow with 10 GPUs would go over the
   quota limit (96 + 10 = 106), causing the workflow to be pending.

3. **Workflow Priority**

   - Higher priority workflows get scheduled first within the pool quota (See :ref:`concepts_priority`)

   - Check your workflow's priority setting

   - Consider adjusting priority if appropriate

4. **Initializing**

   - Sometimes workflows show ``PENDING`` status because they are initializing.

   - Check the task status and events to see detailed information.

5. **More Information**

   - Workflow and task events can provide more information about status and scheduling details.

   - Use the :ref:`cli_reference_workflow_query` command for verbose task information. This is useful for checking rescheduling actions.

What is the difference between quota limit and total capacity?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The quota limit is the number of GPUs that can be used by normal/high priority workflows.

The total capacity is the total number of GPUs that can be used by all workflows in the pool, including low priority (preemptible) workflows.

For example, if the total capacity is greater than the quota limit:

.. code-block:: bash

                                                          Quota Used   Quota Limit   Total Usage   Total Capacity
  ============================================================================================================
  example-pool   Join role: example-role      ONLINE      96           100           96            200
  ============================================================================================================
                                                          96           100           96            200

This usually means that the pool is sharing resources with another pool.
The quota limit for each pool guarantees that users of that pool always has access to those GPUs through normal/high priority workflows.
The difference between total capacity and quota limit (200 - 100 = 100) is the number of GPUs that can be used by low priority workflows
when the other pool is not using its quota limit. But when the other pool is using its quota limit, the low priority workflows will be preempted.

How to use NVIDIA NIM with OSMO?
--------------------------------

NVIDIA NIM allows you to easily deploy containerized models anywhere.

OSMO can be used to both run a NIM as part of a workflow, or it can connect to NIMs hosted through NGC.

First, you will need a NGC API key. If you don't have one, you can follow the instructions at `NIM Getting Started <https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/getting-started.html#generate-an-api-key>`_ to create one.

Next, you will need to create an OSMO secret for the api key.

.. code-block:: bash

  export NGC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
  osmo credential set ngc-api-key --type GENERIC --payload "key=$NGC_API_KEY"


Using a NIM hosted in NGC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following workflow shows an example of using a NIM hosted in NGC.

.. code-block:: yaml

  workflow:
    name: use-nim-from-ngc
    tasks:
    - name: use-nim
      image: ubuntu:24.04
      credentials:
        ngc-api-key:
          NGC_API_KEY: key
      command:
      - bash
      - -c
      - |
          # Install curl and jq to make API calls to the NIM API
          apt update && apt install -y curl jq

          # Define the prompt to send to the NIM API
          data=$'{
            "model": "meta/llama-3.2-1b-instruct",
            "messages": [
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Write a limerick about the wonders of GPU computing."
              }
            ],
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "top_p": 0.7,
            "frequency_penalty": 0,
            "presence_penalty": 0,
            "max_tokens": 48,
            "stream": false
          }'

          # Make the API call to the NIM hosted in NGC and parse the response
          curl -X POST \
          --url "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $NGC_API_KEY" \
          --header "Accept: application/json" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data "$data" |
          jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'


Running a NIM in an OSMO workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can run NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIMs) directly in your OSMO workflows. This allows you to either host a NIM server as part of your workflow or connect to an external NIM service.

For a complete guide with examples, see the `NIM workflow example <https://github.com/NVIDIA/OSMO/tree/main/cookbook/nims>`_.
