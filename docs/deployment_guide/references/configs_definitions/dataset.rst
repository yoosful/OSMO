Dataset config is used to configure dataset storage buckets and access.

Top-Level Configuration
========================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 12 43 20

   * - **Field**
     - **Type**
     - **Description**
     - **Default Values**
   * - ``buckets``
     - `Bucket`_
     - Configuration for available dataset storage buckets.
     - ``{}``
   * - ``default_bucket``
     - String
     - The default bucket identifier to use when none is specified.
     - ``None``

Bucket
======

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 12 43 20

   * - **Field**
     - **Type**
     - **Description**
     - **Default Values**
   * - ``dataset_path``
     - String
     - The URI to the dataset storage location including protocol and bucket/container.
     - Required field
   * - ``region``
     - String
     - The cloud storage region where the bucket is located.
     - ``us-east-1``
   * - ``description``
     - String
     - Human-readable description of the bucket and its intended use.
     - ``None``
   * - ``mode``
     - String
     - Access mode for the bucket. Can be "read-only" or "read-write".
     - ``read-write``
   * - ``default_credential``
     - String/null
     - Default credential identifier to use for this bucket. If null, someone using the bucket will need to specify a credential.
     - ``None``
   * - ``fsx_lustre``
     - `FSx Lustre`_/null
     - Existing FSx for Lustre mount configuration for read-only S3-backed dataset inputs.
     - ``None``

FSx Lustre
==========

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 12 43 20

   * - **Field**
     - **Type**
     - **Description**
     - **Default Values**
   * - ``mount_path``
     - String
     - Absolute path mounted into both ``osmo-ctrl`` and the user container. This path must correspond to the bucket's ``dataset_path`` prefix in the externally managed FSx for Lustre file system.
     - Required field

``fsx_lustre`` is only valid for buckets whose ``dataset_path`` starts with ``s3://``.
OSMO uses the S3 dataset manifest as the source of truth, then maps each manifest
``storage_path`` under ``dataset_path`` to the configured FSx for Lustre
``mount_path`` when a task resolves to ``downloadType: fsx-lustre``.
