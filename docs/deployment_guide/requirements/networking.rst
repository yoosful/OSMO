Networking

.. warning::

   Setting up networking for OSMO requires cloud networking experience, including:

   - Creating and managing SSL/TLS certificates
   - Configuring DNS records and CNAMEs
   - Associating certificates with load balancers

   Please work with IT admins and DevOps team or refer to the cloud provider guides below.


Requirements
--------------

.. only:: html

  .. grid:: 2
      :gutter: 3

      .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`server` OSMO Gateway
          :class-card: tool-card

          The OSMO Gateway (Envoy) is deployed automatically as part of the service chart. It handles traffic routing, authentication, and load balancing.

          **Required for**: External access to OSMO services

      .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`shield-check` Domain and Certificate

          **Requirements**:

          - Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for your OSMO instance
          - Valid SSL/TLS certificate for your domain

          **Example**: ``osmo.example.com``

      .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`globe` DNS Configuration

          Configure DNS CNAME record pointing your FQDN to the OSMO Gateway's LoadBalancer external IP.

          **Required for**: Domain name resolution

      .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`key` Identity provider (optional)

          If using an external IdP for browser SSO (e.g. Microsoft Entra ID, Google), ensure the OSMO service hostname has a dedicated FQDN and certificate. The IdP redirect URI will point to this host.

          **Example**: ``https://<your-domain>/api/auth/getAToken``

      .. grid-item-card:: :octicon:`plug` Port Forwarding (Optional)
          :class-card: optional-card

          FQDN and certificate for wildcard subdomain for UI port forwarding.

          **Example**: ``*.osmo.example.com``
