# OSMO Brev Deployment

[![NVIDIA-OSMO](https://img.shields.io/badge/NVIDIA-OSMO-76b900?logo=nvidia)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OSMO)
[![Deploy on Brev](https://brev-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nv-lb-dark.svg)](https://brev.nvidia.com/launchable/deploy?launchableID=env-36a6a7qnkOMOP2vgiBRaw2e3jpW)

The OSMO Brev deployment provides a pre-configured OSMO instance running in the cloud, allowing you to quickly try OSMO without setting up local infrastructure. This deployment uses a [Brev.dev](https://brev.dev) cloud instance with the [OSMO local deployment](https://nvidia.github.io/OSMO/main/deployment_guide/appendix/deploy_local.html) pre-installed.

> The Brev deployment is for evaluation purposes only and is not recommended for production use as it lacks authentication and has limited resources.

## Compute requirements

- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (>=1.18.1)
- NVIDIA Driver Version (>=575)

**Test definitions:**
- **Hello World** — `ubuntu:22.04`, 1 CPU / 1Gi memory / 0 GPU
- **Disk Fill** — `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:24.12` (~40 GB); validates Docker data-root relocation
- **GPU Workload** — verifies GPU is exposed in the default pool, then runs MNIST CNN on `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.03-py3`

**Status codes:** ✅ · ❌ · `—` (not applicable)

## Accessing the Brev Deployment

### Web UI Access

The OSMO Web UI is available through a secure Brev link exposed from your instance:

1. Log in to your Brev console at https://console.brev.dev
2. Navigate to your OSMO instance
3. Select "Access"
4. Under `Using Secure Links`, click `Share a Service` and enter port `8000`
5. Click on the "Shareable URL" for port `8000`

## [Optional] Local CLI Setup

To use the OSMO CLI and UI from your local machine, you'll need to set up port forwarding and install the necessary tools.

### Step 1: Install Brev CLI

Follow instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/brev/latest/brev-cli.html#installation-instructions). Be sure to `brev login`.

### Step 2: Set Up Port Forwarding

Forward ports from your Brev instance to your local machine. Port 8000 provides access to the OSMO API and Web UI. Port 4566 provides access to the LocalStack S3 storage backend, which is required for dataset download and upload via the CLI.

You can find your instance's IP address at the top of the deployment page.

You can see your username in the Brev Console:

1. Log in to your Brev console at https://console.brev.dev
2. Navigate to your OSMO instance
3. Select "Logs"
4. Look at the output of "Script Logs". You should see `Current user: [brev instance username]`

```bash
# Find your instance name with brev ls
sudo ssh -i ~/.brev/brev.pem -p 22 -L 80:localhost:8000 <username>@[your instance IP]
```

If you see `Permission denied (publickey)` it may be because:

- You did not log in using `brev login`

### Step 3: Set Up Networking

Add host entries so that the OSMO CLI and browser can reach the cluster services via localhost:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 quick-start.osmo" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 localstack-s3.osmo" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

`quick-start.osmo` allows you to visit the Web UI at `http://quick-start.osmo` in your browser. `localstack-s3.osmo` allows the OSMO CLI to reach the S3 storage backend for dataset download and upload.

### Step 4: Install OSMO CLI

Download and install the OSMO command-line interface:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OSMO/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Step 5: Log In to OSMO

Authenticate with the OSMO instance through your port forward:

```bash
osmo login http://quick-start.osmo --method=dev --username=testuser
```

### Step 6: Set Dataset Credential

Register the storage credential so the CLI can download and upload datasets. The setup script saves this command on the Brev node during installation. In a separate terminal, retrieve and run it:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.brev/brev.pem shadeform@[your instance IP] 'cat ~/osmo-deployment/set-credential.sh' | bash
```

## Next Steps

Visit the [User Guide](https://nvidia.github.io/OSMO/main/user_guide/getting_started/next_steps.html#getting-started-next-steps) for tutorials on submitting workflows, interactive development, distributed training, and more.

- [Brev Documentation](https://docs.brev.dev)

## Cleanup

Close the port-forward session with:

```bash
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -ti:80)
```

Delete your Brev instance through the Brev console or CLI:

```bash
brev delete [your instance name]
```

# Deploying Custom OSMO Chart

1. Build and push your quick-start chart to the registry.

2. Go to [brev.nvidia.com](https://brev.nvidia.com) and create a new environment.
   - **L40S 1xGPU** on MassedCompute works well, but any L40 or L40S instance should work.

3. Wait for the node to finish starting up.

4. Shell into the instance:

   ```bash
   brev shell <your node name>
   ```

5. Download the setup script:

   ```bash
   curl -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OSMO/main/deployments/brev/setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

6. Edit `setup.sh` to install your version and use your registry key

7. Run the setup script:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

Once you are complete, you can follow the instructions above on to access your Brev instance.
